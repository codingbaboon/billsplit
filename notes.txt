-get the item it's associated with
-if checkbox is checked, then change index of owner to 1 in the item object
== +1 to owner total
-if checkbox is unchecked, then change the index of owner to 0 in the item object
== -1 to owner total

Calculate()
-do (price/ownersClaimed) to get the total for each claimed person
-iterate through items object array
==look at the item Objects 'claimed' attrbute [0,0,1,0,1]
*** every time there is a 1:
==> push the item name onto the Owner object's "claimed items" array (secondary)
==> add the subtotal to the Owner objects 'total' attribute
